The dashboards will provide an overview of key information relevant to each role.\n*   **Student Management Module:** Enable the registration of new students, capturing essential information, and automatically generating unique student IDs.\n*   **Class Scheduling & Timetable:** Allow the creation and management of class timetables, preventing double-booking and displaying weekly/monthly calendar views.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2E86AB` (A calming blue for main actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#82E0AA` (A soft green for positive feedback)\n    *   Accent: `#F39C12` (An orange for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#AED6F1` (Light blue for selections or active elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional and readable interface.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Create new screens:** Create new screens for the admin, tutor, student, and parent dashboards in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n2.  **Implement User Authentication:** Implement a basic authentication flow (you will need to enable Supabase for full authentication). For now, create a simple mock authentication to simulate different user roles.\n3.  **Student Management Module:** Create a new component for student registration and display.\n4.  **Class Scheduling & Timetable:** Create a new component for managing class schedules.\n5.  **Modify app/(tabs)/\\_layout.tsx:** Modify the tab layout to include the new screens.\n6.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T10:06:21.104914"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive Tutoring Management System for Matsepe Academy of Tutoring.

You want to add a profile creation page for students, parents, tutors, and admins, and implement a notification system in the admin profile to track new profile creations. Here's a design vision and implementation plan:\n\n**1. Profile Creation Page:**\n\n*   **Unified Form:** Create a single profile creation page (`/app/create-profile.tsx`) with dynamic form fields based on the user role. This form should collect relevant information for each role (e.g., student ID, parent contact info, tutor qualifications, admin credentials).\n*   **Role Selection:** Include a role selection step (if not already determined) to tailor the form fields accordingly.\n*   **Data Storage:** Upon submission, store the profile data. Since Supabase is available, consider using it for persistent storage.\n*   **UI Elements:** Use React Native components like `TextInput`, `Picker` (for role selection), and `Button` for a user-friendly interface.\n\n**2. Admin Notification System:**\n\n*   **Notification Component:** Create a reusable `Notification` component to display new profile creation alerts in the admin dashboard.\n*   **Data Fetching:** In the admin dashboard (`/app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` - renderAdminDashboard function), fetch the list of newly created profiles (or a count) from Supabase.\n*   **Real-time Updates:** Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions to immediately display new profile creation notifications.\n*   **Notification Details:** Display relevant information in the notification, such as the user's name, role, and creation timestamp.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  Create the `create-profile.tsx` page with dynamic form fields.\n2.  Modify the admin dashboard (`/app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`) to fetch and display profile creation notifications.\n3.

You want a comprehensive Tutoring Management System for Matsepe Academy of Tutoring, covering student enrollment, class scheduling, tutor management, payments, progress monitoring, and communication. It should have different user roles (admin, tutor, student, parent, receptionist), and a clean, modern design with academy branding.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **User Authentication and Role-Based Dashboards:** Implement login/sign-up functionality with distinct dashboards for admin, tutors, students, and parents. The dashboards will provide an overview of key information relevant to each role.\n*   **Student Management Module:** Enable the registration of new students, capturing essential information, and automatically generating unique student IDs.\n*   **Class Scheduling & Timetable:** Allow the creation and management of class timetables, preventing double-booking and displaying weekly/monthly calendar views.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2E86AB` (A calming blue for main actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#82E0AA` (A soft green for positive feedback)\n    *   Accent: `#F39C12` (An orange for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#AED6F1` (Light blue for selections or active elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional and readable interface.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Create new screens:** Create new screens for the admin, tutor, student, and parent dashboards in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n2.  **Implement User Authentication:** Implement a basic authentication flow (you will need to enable Supabase for full authentication). For now, create a simple mock authentication to simulate different user roles.\n3.  **Student Management Module:** Create a new component for student registration and display.\n4.  **Class Scheduling & Timetable:** Create a new component for managing class schedules.\n5.  **Modify app/(tabs)/\\_layout.tsx:** Modify the tab layout to include the new screens.\n6.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T10:06:21.104914"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive Tutoring Management System for Matsepe Academy of Tutoring.

You want to add a profile creation page for students, parents, tutors, and admins, and implement a notification system in the admin profile to track new profile creations. Here's a design vision and implementation plan:\n\n**1. Profile Creation Page:**\n\n*   **Unified Form:** Create a single profile creation page (`/app/create-profile.tsx`) with dynamic form fields based on the user role. This form should collect relevant information for each role (e.g., student ID, parent contact info, tutor qualifications, admin credentials).\n*   **Role Selection:** Include a role selection step (if not already determined) to tailor the form fields accordingly.\n*   **Data Storage:** Upon submission, store the profile data. Since Supabase is available, consider using it for persistent storage.\n*   **UI Elements:** Use React Native components like `TextInput`, `Picker` (for role selection), and `Button` for a user-friendly interface.\n\n**2. Admin Notification System:**\n\n*   **Notification Component:** Create a reusable `Notification` component to display new profile creation alerts in the admin dashboard.\n*   **Data Fetching:** In the admin dashboard (`/app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` - renderAdminDashboard function), fetch the list of newly created profiles (or a count) from Supabase.\n*   **Real-time Updates:** Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions to immediately display new profile creation notifications.\n*   **Notification Details:** Display relevant information in the notification, such as the user's name, role, and creation timestamp.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  Create the `create-profile.tsx` page with dynamic form fields.\n2.  Modify the admin dashboard (`/app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`) to fetch and display profile creation notifications.\n3.  Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions.\n\nTo proceed, please enable Supabase so I can provide specific code snippets for data storage and real-time updates.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T10:13:54.520216"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant information to understand the current implementation and then create the profile creation page with admin notifications."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "contexts/AuthContext.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "data/mockData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me check the styles file:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

You want a comprehensive Tutoring Management System for Matsepe Academy of Tutoring, covering student enrollment, class scheduling, tutor management, payments, progress monitoring, and communication. It should have different user roles (admin, tutor, student, parent, receptionist), and a clean, modern design with academy branding.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **User Authentication and Role-Based Dashboards:** Implement login/sign-up functionality with distinct dashboards for admin, tutors, students, and parents. The dashboards will provide an overview of key information relevant to each role.\n*   **Student Management Module:** Enable the registration of new students, capturing essential information, and automatically generating unique student IDs.\n*   **Class Scheduling & Timetable:** Allow the creation and management of class timetables, preventing double-booking and displaying weekly/monthly calendar views.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2E86AB` (A calming blue for main actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#82E0AA` (A soft green for positive feedback)\n    *   Accent: `#F39C12` (An orange for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#AED6F1` (Light blue for selections or active elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional and readable interface.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Create new screens:** Create new screens for the admin, tutor, student, and parent dashboards in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n2.  **Implement User Authentication:** Implement a basic authentication flow (you will need to enable Supabase for full authentication). For now, create a simple mock authentication to simulate different user roles.\n3.  **Student Management Module:** Create a new component for student registration and display.\n4.  **Class Scheduling & Timetable:** Create a new component for managing class schedules.\n5.  **Modify app/(tabs)/\\_layout.tsx:** Modify the tab layout to include the new screens.\n6.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T10:06:21.104914"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive Tutoring Management System for Matsepe Academy of Tutoring.
